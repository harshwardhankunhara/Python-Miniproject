# Code Implementation:
First, take the length of the password as input. Then we can display a prompt about the possible list of characters that a user wants to include in the password â€“
For including letters in the character set append string.ascii_letters in the character list.
For including letters in the character set append string.digits in the character list.
For including letters in character set append string.punctuation in the character list.
Run a for loop till the length of the password and in each iteration choose a random character using random.choice() from characterList. Finally, print the password.
